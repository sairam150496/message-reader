# A messsage App

This is mainly used to read, edit and delete the messages. 

This app internally uses touch events which are only supported by mobile devices. I tried extending the functionalities to @16/9 or greater aspect ratio devices but douldn't do it due to lack of time.

#### Key Functionalities

- Opens delete option on moving the card left to right.
- Opens edit option on moving the card right to left. Only message is edited.
